      <p className="history-text">
        We are a small family business that started in 2010. We have been growing and selling
        flowers for over a decade. Our passion for flowers and nature has driven us to create a
        beautiful garden center where you can find the best flowers and plants for your home and
        garden.
      </p>

      <p>
        We take pride in our work and are committed to sustainability and eco-friendly practices. We
        source our flowers from local growers whenever possible and use organic methods to care for
        our plants. Our goal is to create a beautiful and sustainable garden center that you can
        feel good about supporting.
